## Welcome to FileBucket

FileBucket is a single web page app that allows users to upload and save photos. After signing up for an account with FileBucket, the user may upload load pictures of buckets, share them, and download them. User owned resources can be updated and deleted, while resources belonging to other owners can be viewed and downloaded. Images are stored in S3 on AWS while information regarding image tags are saved to our database using an Express back-end.

### User stories:
1. As a user I should be able to upload (post) new files and see a list of all my files at once (index) and individually (show).

2. As a user, I should be able to update (patch) and delete my files (delete).

3. As a user, only my own files should be deleted and updated by me.

4. As a user, I want anyone to be able to read and download them.

5. As a user, I should be able to sign up and sign in with a email and password.

6. As a user, I should be able to change password or sign out after being signed into my user account.
